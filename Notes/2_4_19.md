# Homework 1 notes
The intent was to use only $100 total for strategy two.  My implementation assumes there is an infinite supply of $100
starting funds available every time the condition that the adjusted closing price is greater than the small window 
moving average.  Implementation would've been a bit more complex if you only have $100 total to spend.

Also, for the month, i just grabbed the whole month and averaged it.  but i think he intended (now that i'm remembering)
that he wanted to basically take the last day return and subtract from it the first day return.

# Choice of models
Choice of hyperparameters
  - examples
    - w (as size of the moving average window)
    
# Topics
## NumPy
## Homework assignment
  - Add more strategies
  - Discuss some statistical functions
 
norm dist: within single sd: 68%, w/i 2 sd: 95%, w/i 3 sd: 97.5%
 
we'll be establishing that the stock we've chosen does not (or does) follow a normal distribution

# error analysis
given a = (a1, a2, ..., an)
actual values

and given P = (p1, p2, ..., pn)
compute the error in your model
