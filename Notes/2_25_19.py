Homework 5
Need a labeled data set
2017 + 2018 - label every week as "green"
(good week to be invested)
and "red" (better be in cash)

Generate (x, y) points for each week (2017 - 2018 roughly 105 data points)
For week i: xi = np.mean([r1, r2, r3, r4, r5])
yi = np.std([r1, r2, r3, r4, r5])

Why do we need this:
(1) KNN - nearest neighbors
(2) Naive Bayesian

Data Scaling: (already in blackboard)

Numeric Python:
