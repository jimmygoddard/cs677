# Data sets:
- Pick our own data set which will be stock ticker data for any company whose name begins with the same letter as the first letter of our last name
- We'll be using 5 years worth of data for that stock ticker

# Homework
- Every week

# Quizzes
- Every two weeks

# Final Exam

# Final Project
- Open ended
- Should _not_ be connected with the stock market
- Anything to do with data science

# Book
- Python for Data Analysis (i think i already have it)

# Modules
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

# First assignment
- Will be done in vanilla python.  don't use numpy or pandas
- Step 1: run the script with your stock ticker and save the results into a csv file
- Step 2: read the stock data into list of lists (lines... splitlines is giving just a list of strings)
  - [line.split(',') for line in file.splitlines()] # will give list of lists
- Implement the following strategies:
  - if you decide to hold a stock for 1 day, what is the best day of the week to do so
    - for every day of the week, construct a list of daily returns for that day
    - compute avg, min and max for each of those lists
    - result will be a table (basically list of lists. round everything to two decimal points):

      day of week | min | max | avg | median

      Monday      | mon_min | mon_max | mon_avg| mon_med
  - if you decide to buy stock for one month, what would be the best/worst month
    - take first return of month, last return of month and compute return for that month
    - collect all of those monthly returns into lists and do the above analysis (same table as the daily analysis)
    - [calculate daily return](https://www.sapling.com/6453081/calculate-daily-return): return = (p2 - p1 / p2)
  
  Trading strategies:
  - if your stock is down W days in a row, buy on day W and sell next day: put $100 at adj closing price
  
  Example:
  
  Day 1 : -3%
  
  Day 2: -2%
  
  Day 3: -1%   adj Price = $10
  
  You buy 10 shares       

  Next day, sell that number of shares at the adj close price
  
  "How many days should I wait sequentially before I buy"
  
  It's unlikely that you'll get something like 6 days in a row of a stock being down
  
  Example:
  
  For W = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:
  
  After W consecutive declines, buy on day W ($100).  Sell on W + 1
    
  Generate following summary table:
  
  W     | # Transactions | # Profitable Trades | Profit per profitable trade | # Losing Trades | Average Loss per Losing Trade | Average P/L  

  Same statistics as before: breakdown by losing and winning trades         

# Compounded interest
See ClassOne.py

  - Optional assignment:
  
  assume you know tomorrow, start with a $100 (assume you never lose.  if tomorrow stock is higher then buy today.  if tomorrow stock is lower, sell today)

  Q: how much money would you have on 12/31/2018?    

# Tasks
- Get historical stock data going back 5 years
- 2 ways to do this: use Python script
- (use pandas to get the data, but the rest needs to be done in straight python?  not sure what that means)
- Set NaN values to 0
- Split the date column into day, month, year, day of week.  that way you can answer questions like "is there a best day on which you should purchase stock?"
